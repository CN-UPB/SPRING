# SPRING
Scaling, Placement, and RoutING for Pliable Virtualized Composed Services

**A-SPRING** (included here as a submodule that will take you to the original repository) includes the implementation of the scaling, placement, and routing optimization and heuristic approaches for **pliable services with arbitrarily ordered components**. This is the evaluation code used in the following publications. Please cite our papers if you are using the code.

**U-SPRING** is the imeplementation of the scaling, placement, and routing optimization and heuristic approaches for **uni-directional pliable services with load-proportional structures**. This is the evaluation code used in the following publications. Please cite our papers if you are using the code. The implementation of the approaches was mainly done by Z. A. Mann.

**B-SPRING** (included here as a submodule that will take you to the original repository) is the imeplementation of the scaling, placement, and routing optimization and heuristic approaches for **bi-directional pliable services with load-proportional structures**. The following release is the evaluation code used in the following publications. Please cite our papers if you are using the code. The implementation of the approaches was mainly done by S. Schneider.
